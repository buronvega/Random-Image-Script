# Random Image Script

Simple JS script that displays images randomly from specific sources. 

### Changing the number of images
To use a different number of images, add each new image on a line of its own, following the same format.

You also need to change the number in the ```ImageArray()``` to reflect the total number of images *remember to count the "zero"*.
